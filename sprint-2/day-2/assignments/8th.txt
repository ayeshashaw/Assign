L0: Basic MongoDB Setup and Collection Setup
1. Initialize MongoDB Database:
To create the Library_DB database, run the following command in the Mongo Shell or Compass:

use Library_DB
2. Create books Collection:
MongoDB will automatically create the collection when you insert the first document, so there's no need for explicit collection creation.

3. Insert Sample Data:
Here are some sample data entries for the books collection:


db.books.insertMany([
  {
    book_id: 1,
    title: "The Catcher in the Rye",
    author: "J.D. Salinger",
    genre: "fiction",
    available: true
  },
  {
    book_id: 2,
    title: "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind",
    author: "Yuval Noah Harari",
    genre: "non-fiction",
    available: false
  },
  {
    book_id: 3,
    title: "1984",
    author: "George Orwell",
    genre: "fiction",
    available: true
  },
  {
    book_id: 4,
    title: "The Silent Patient",
    author: "Alex Michaelides",
    genre: "thriller",
    available: true
  },
  {
    book_id: 5,
    title: "Educated",
    author: "Tara Westover",
    genre: "non-fiction",
    available: false
  }
]);
Basic Read Operations:
4. Retrieve all books:

db.books.find()
5. Retrieve books based on their genre (e.g., all fiction books):

db.books.find({ genre: "fiction" })
6. Retrieve only available books:

db.books.find({ available: true })
