L0: Basic MongoDB Setup and Collection Setup
1. Initialize MongoDB Database:
To create the Order_DB database, run the following command in the Mongo Shell or Compass:


use Order_DB
2. Create orders Collection:
MongoDB will automatically create the collection when the first document is inserted, so there's no need to explicitly create it.

3. Insert Sample Data:
Here are some sample data entries for the orders collection:


db.orders.insertMany([
  {
    order_id: 1,
    customer_name: "John Doe",
    items: ["Laptop", "Mouse", "Keyboard"],
    total_amount: 25000,
    order_status: "pending"
  },
  {
    order_id: 2,
    customer_name: "Jane Smith",
    items: ["Smartphone", "Headphones"],
    total_amount: 12000,
    order_status: "shipped"
  },
  {
    order_id: 3,
    customer_name: "Alice Brown",
    items: ["Tablet", "Charger"],
    total_amount: 8000,
    order_status: "delivered"
  },
  {
    order_id: 4,
    customer_name: "Bob White",
    items: ["Monitor", "Mousepad"],
    total_amount: 3000,
    order_status: "pending"
  },
  {
    order_id: 5,
    customer_name: "Charlie Green",
    items: ["Camera", "Lens", "Tripod"],
    total_amount: 18000,
    order_status: "shipped"
  }
]);
Basic Read Operations:
4. Retrieve all orders:

db.orders.find()
5. Retrieve orders with a specific status (e.g., pending orders):

db.orders.find({ order_status: "pending" })
6. Retrieve orders with a total amount greater than Rs. 1000:

db.orders.find({ total_amount: { $gt: 1000 } })
