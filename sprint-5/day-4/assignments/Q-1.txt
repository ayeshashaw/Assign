Backend Architecture and Database Strategy

Backend Architecture

1)Decision: Monolithic vs. Microservices

Ans:Chosen Architecture: Monolithic

Justification:

A).Complexity: The project does not have extreme complexity at the initial stages, making a monolithic architecture easier to develop and manage.

B).Projected User Base: While scalability is a concern, starting with a monolithic design allows for easier deployment and maintenance. If needed, the system can be modularized and transitioned to microservices later.

C).Development Team Size: A smaller development team benefits from the simplicity of a monolithic approach, avoiding the complexities of managing multiple services.

Pros:

A).Easier to develop and debug due to a unified codebase.

B).Simple deployment and monitoring.

C).Lower infrastructure costs initially.

Cons:

A).Scalability may become an issue as the project grows.

B).Codebase can become difficult to manage over time.

2).Database Selection

Ans:Decision: SQL vs. NoSQL

Chosen Database: NoSQL (MongoDB)

Justification:

A).Data Structure & Access Patterns: The project requires flexible and dynamic data storage, making a NoSQL database like MongoDB more suitable.

B).CAP Considerations: MongoDB prioritizes availability and partition tolerance, making it ideal for distributed systems.

C).Scalability Needs: MongoDB offers horizontal scaling with built-in sharding and replication, allowing for efficient scaling as the project grows.

D).Future Data Management: Schema-less design allows for rapid iterations and adjustments as requirements evolve.

Pros:

A).High scalability and flexibility.

B).Supports unstructured and semi-structured data.

C).Efficient querying for document-based storage.

Cons:

A).Less strict data integrity compared to SQL.

B).Requires careful indexing and optimization for complex queries.

3).Basic Security Measures

Ans: Decision: Prioritized Security Practices

A).Input Validation: Prevents NoSQL injection, XSS, and other malicious payloads.

B).Rate Limiting: Helps mitigate brute-force attacks and API abuse.

C).Secure Headers: Uses middleware like helmet.js to enforce security policies.

D).Authentication & Authorization: Implement JWT with role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict sensitive operations.

E).Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data both at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS/SSL).

F).Logging & Monitoring: Use tools like Winston and Morgan for logging and intrusion detection.

Justification:

A).Protects against common security threats like XSS, CSRF, and NoSQL Injection.

B).Ensures compliance with best practices for handling sensitive user data.

C).Reduces exposure to unauthorized access and data breaches.

4).API Documentation

Ans:Decision: Swagger (OpenAPI)

Justification:

1).Developer Communication: Provides clear, interactive API documentation for front-end and third-party developers.

2).Automation & Maintenance: Allows auto-generation of API documentation from the codebase.

3).Usability: Supports testing API endpoints within the interface, improving development efficiency.

Pros:

1).Well-structured documentation.

2).Supports integration with other tools like Postman.

3).Helps standardize API usage.

Cons:

A).Requires updates alongside code changes.

4).CI/CD Pipeline

Ans:Decision: GitHub Actions

Justification:

A).Pipeline Structure:

Automated testing on push and pull requests.

Code linting and static analysis.

Deployment triggers for staging and production environments.

B).Why GitHub Actions?

Integrated directly with GitHub, reducing setup complexity.

Supports customizable workflows with YAML.

Seamless integration with cloud providers like AWS and Docker.

C).Pros:

Automates testing, building, and deployment processes.

Reduces manual errors in deployments.

Improves development workflow with continuous integration.

D).Cons:

Requires setup and maintenance for optimal performance.

Conclusion

The chosen backend architecture and database strategy align with project goals by ensuring scalability, security, and maintainability. A monolithic architecture simplifies initial development, while MongoDB provides flexible data management. Security practices safeguard the application, Swagger improves API communication, and GitHub Actions automates deployment, creating a solid foundation for future growth.
